# FILE-MOVER

IF YOU DONT HAVE PYTHON OR PACKAGES INSTALLED JUST RUN THE .exe FILE BUT READ README.md BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION OR PROGRAM.
FOR RUNNING THE .exe FILE YOU DONT NEED/REQUIRE PYTHON INSTALLED IN YOUR SYSTEM.

This is mainly designed to move only files(not folders) from one location to another (when a large number/mixture of data are invoved).
Ever felt like you have too much files in a folder like different kind of file extensions from .exe,.mp4,.mp3 and many many other forms of files
Then use this tool to sort the files and move them to your desired location.Here's how you use this application

Sometimes in few cases the teminal might become inactive, if so click the terminal screen to make it active and type the inputs.

Few keywords used below:
 
-->SOURCE: initial location of the file that you wish to move(THE FILE ITSELF)
-->DESTINATION: location to where the file has to be moved
-->PATH:the address of source or destination
 
->Step 1:
       Execute the application

->Step 2:
       In the terminal window type 1 or 2 when it is prompted and press ENTER on your keyboard
       
       A)TYPED 1 and pressed ENTER:
                   It means that you have decided to cut (i.e)remove the file from SOURCE and paste it in DESTINATION folder/PATH
         
       NOTE: THE FILE WILL BE MOVED TO DESTINATION AND WILL NOT BE THERE AT THE SOURCE FOLDER ONCE THE PROCESS COMPLETES,
             
       
       B)TYPED 2 and pressed ENTER:
                   It means that you have decided to copy (i.e)create a copy of file and copy the file from SOURCE and paste it in DESTINATION folder/PATH
           
       NOTE: THE FILE WILL BE PRESENT BOTH AT THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION FOLDER ONCE THE PROCESS COMPLETES,
             

->Step 3:
       A File dialog will be opened, choose where you want to place the files(DESTINATION FOLDER) .At the next Step you can choose if you want to create a new folder or not 
       

->Step 4:
       Now you are required to mention the name of the new folder--> inside the terminal type what you want to name it and press ENTER, there are 2 options available to you:
       
       OPTION 1: Type in the ANY NAME OF YOUR CHOICE and press ENTER:
                               
                 It means that a "new folder" with the name that you type in this step will be created as the DESTINATION folder inside the path
                 For.eg: during this step if someone types "TEST", a new folder with the name "TEST" will be created inside the DESTINATION folder
              
                NOTE:(If you choose Downloads in Step 3 then the "new folder" will be created inside Downloads and the DESTINATION folder is C:\..\Downloads\new folder)
       
       OPTION 2: Press ENTER without typing in name:

                 It means that no "new folder" will be created and the files will be place at the folder chosen at STEP 3
                 
                 NOTE:(If left empty and at Step 3 Downloads folder is chosen then DESTINATION folder is C:\..\Downloads)

->Step 5:
      Once again another File dialog will appear and now you must choose the  SOURCE (i.e) choose what files you want to move to DESTINATION folder.
     
      NOTE:You can choose what type of files you wish to see inside the File Dialog but choosing it at the filetype which is present at lower right corner of the Dialog box
           
           If it does not show the file extensions after choosing them from the filetype then navigate out and back into the folder again 
           
           By DEFAULT AllType of file extensions will be displayed, you can choose to display .mp4,.png et cetera.
->Step 6:
      After the process completes the application will close automatically.

To stop or cancel the process inside the terminal window type ctrl+z/ctrl+x(not a problem if you cant see what u typed in terminal) and press enter

LIMITATIONS:
-->IF file with samename or file already exists at DESTINATION folder then it will be overwritten cannot UNDO the process.
